<blockquote>A bit of information (data) always has a certain type</blockquote>

Each programming language has different data-types or names them differently, but most of them have a variation of these four:

### Booleans
`Booleans` are simple binary values (`true` or `false`).
```
isTrue = true
isFalse = false
```

In our previous article about [if statements](https://codetips.co.uk/beginner/what-is-an-if-statement/) we showed you how programs determine between executing a block of code or not. The condition that is used for this can ultimately only have two outcomes: **do it** (`true`) or **don't do it** (`false`).

### Integers
`Integers` are whole numbers (with no decimal places).
```
number = 5
```

### Floats
`Floats` are numbers that **can** have decimals, but do not always have to.
```
number = 3.5
```

### Strings
`Strings` are simply a series of characters (like words, names or whole sentences)
```
id = ckjasdiwe98213
name = John
lastname = Doe
job = John is working at a farm, growing potatoes
```
